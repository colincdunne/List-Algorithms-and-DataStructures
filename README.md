This program will load a database from a chosen file (set in code).
It will allow you to view the database of players.
You can check if a specific player is in the database by searching there name.
Can show specific player info by searching with name.
Add a new player to the database, update and existing player and remove a player from the database.
You can sort the players in the database by using bubble sort, which will order them by the number associated with them in the database.
It does this by setting the lowest number as the first record and so on.
Finally you can save the database to the file by writing out to it using the PrintWriter function.
